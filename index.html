<p>From <a

<blockquote>
<p>InnerSource is the use of <a

<aside class="notes">
<p>As with all in our field. development practices is very vague. For
simplicity I‚Äôll stick with what I consider the big two.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<h3 id="publicly-accessible">Publicly accessible</h3>
<ul>
<li>source control (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)</li>
<li>bug/task list</li>
<li>community or communication channels</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>The first group of practices revolves around public accessibility, or
can people that are not a part of the project or effort get to it
freely.</p>
<p>This access impact three main things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the source control system that the project uses accessible to the
public. I feel it‚Äôs important to specify a VCS and not default to a
folder somewhere on the internet. The practice of the community is to
have version control at the forefront of our projects.</li>
<li>Is the bug or task list accessible. An important part for a open
source project to have publicly available. This is the only clear way
people outside of the project can know where a project needs help and
where to report any issues.</li>
<li>Last but not least, community. This is a bit more ‚Äúwhatever works‚Äù
for the maintainers. Many open source project default to have a
community around them and have communications or the core team
public.</li>
</ul>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<h3 id="contributor-and-community-guidance">contributor and community
guidance</h3>
<ul>
<li>documentation</li>
<li>how to contribute</li>
<li>code of conduct</li>
<li>WYSIWYG / as is</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>It‚Äôs very common for mature projects that have a community of
contributors and users to dedicate time to this.</p>
<p>Most successful open source projects of any size have clear
instructions as to how to interact with the community and the
project.</p>
<p>The general practice on platforms like GitHub is to have a
CONTRIBUTING.md file that states how exactly new and established
contributor should submit any contribution back to the project. This
helps keep expectations in place as well as give the project maintainer
some predictability when going into reviewing a pull request.</p>
<p>That said, it‚Äôs totally OK for a project to say that there is not
community around this project and that it‚Äôs not accepting any
contributions. The importance is to say so and be clear with people that
are interested.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="open-source-like-culture" class="slide level2">
<h2>Open Source-like culture</h2>

<section class="slide level2">

<p><img

<aside class="notes">
<p>This made we pause and think.</p>
<p>As a term, open source has been around since 1995. Since that time it
has made it‚Äôs way into the vocabulary fields outside of software. Data,
art, literature, government, medicine, manufacturing. All these
communities have taken up open source as a concept in some way.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs given rise to the modern maker and craft movement, creating
commons, open data, open government and open culture movements.</p>
<p>After a while of me just sitting, trying to articulate what was in my
brain, I looked for a word cloud generator and pasted text from some
wikipedia articles about the subject. Just to see what would come up</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<p><img data-src="images/word-cloud.svg" style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>I asked the tool for 50 words and this is what came up.</p>
<p>Taking a look at this, we see the all too common open, source, and
open-source terms.</p>
<p>We also see some interesting ones, creative, movement, community,
exchange, free, public, and innovation</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<h3

embrace of openness and free exchange of ideas to push a community‚Äôs
creativity and innovation to solve problems</h3>
<aside class="notes">
<p>So with that I‚Äôll try to define open source culture as:</p>
<p>The embrace of openness and free exchange of ideas to push a
community‚Äôs creativity and innovation to solve problems.</p>

<h1>What does that mean for us</h1>

</section>
<section id="collaboration" class="slide level2">
<h2>collaboration</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Let‚Äôs start with how we can collaborate in a more open and community
driven way.</p>
<p>We need to be able to accept contributions into our repos from other
pods. Even from teammates that aren‚Äôt engineers. Closing ourselves off
only creates silos and makes it difficult for us feed off of each
other‚Äôs knowledge.</p>
<p>While a pod may be the code owner for a repo, we should invite
outside contributions, be it code, documentation, bugs, and especially
questions.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<p><img data-src="images/github-logo.png" width="500" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>This is where GitHub shines.</p>
<p>A big part of a project is not just it‚Äôs code but also decisions,
conversations, brainstorms, failures, and fixes. Keeping these close to
the code makes finding these simpler. The easier it is to find something
to collaborate on, the higher the chances are to receive
contributions.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<p><img data-src="images/github-collab-features.png" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>README files, GitHub issues, GitHub discussions, GitHub projects, and
pull requests are our primary tools to make collaboration as simpler as
we can make it.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="openness" class="slide level2">
<h2>openness</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Promoting collaboration and enabling it needs to go hand in hand with
openness. In fact they could have been in the same section.</p>
<p>I thought it important to keep separate for one specific reason</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<h3 id="repo-visibility">Repo visibility</h3>
<p><img data-src="images/github-repo-visibility.png" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>To be able to collaborate on a repository we first need to be able to
see it and submit contributions to it. Repository visibility is one of
the low hanging fruits that any enterprise can change today.</p>
<p>An internal repository is a repo that can be accessed by anybody that
is a member of the GitHub enterprise org. The default access is of read
but could be changed to write. This will enable everybody to contribute
to a repo in the form of a pull request.</p>
<p>It will also let private repositories fulfill their roles as a
private space for any sensitive needs.</p>
<p>A private repository is a repo that will only be viewable to the
creator, teams or individuals that are granted access to it, and the
GitHub enterprise org admins.</p>
<p>Private repositories can be used just as internal repos and default
access can be granted through the enterprise settings but this creates
unneeded friction and overhead to repo owners in the management of repo
access.</p>

style="width:100.0%" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>You may be saying to yourself</p>
<p>‚ÄúFroi, giving write access to everybody to my repo is dangerous.‚Äù</p>
<p>I‚Äôm glad you thought that because that leads use to ‚Ä¶.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="governance" class="slide level2">
<h2>governance</h2>
<aside class="notes">
<p>A big part of the success of major open source project is their
project governance. In other words how they manage their repo and what
rules and expectations they set for their contributors.</p>
<p>An enterprise practicing inner source is not different.</p>
<p>Even with tight access management, a team should have proper
governance in place for their repo. This helps to ensure that not only
are contributions following an approved process, but contributor will
also know how to submit contributions.</p>
<p>Contributions that follow a good repo governance have a higher change
of being better quality submissions, which in turn increases their
chance of being accepted, and in turn increases the amount of
contributions received.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section class="slide level2">

<h3 id="implementing">Implementing</h3>
<ul>
<li>READMEs</li>
<li>CONTRIBUTING.md files</li>
<li>code of conduct (important for any public facing open source
projects)</li>
<li>CODEOWNERS files</li>
<li>branch protections</li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
<p>To help us with governance, each repo should have most, if not all of
these support files and features implemented.</p>
</aside>
</section>
<section id="community" class="slide level2">
<h2>community</h2>
<p><img
data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/DPVjijLfZOGArKi8Kr/giphy.gif" /></p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>At the end all this is about fostering a contributor community in our
enterprise. The past 20 years have shown how strong developer
communities, regardless if they work in the public view or behind a
firewall, create better software, are more effective, and innovate at a
faster pace.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm not going to lie and say that these changes are easy or that we
can do them over night. But I do think that it‚Äôs worth to put the effort
and start implementing them in a strategic way that can enable us help
our teammate push the best products they can</p>
